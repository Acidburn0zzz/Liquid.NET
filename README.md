# Liquid.NET

Liquid.NET is a C# port of the [Shopify Liquid parser](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics).

Although we use it in production, it should be considered beta software.

More information is on the [Liquid.NET Wiki](https://github.com/mikebridge/Liquid.NET/wiki).
