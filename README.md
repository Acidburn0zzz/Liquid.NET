# Liquid.NET

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3g2a81kc3aqfo87j?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mikebridge/liquid-net)

Liquid.NET is an independent C# port of the [Shopify Liquid parser](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics).  

Although we use it in production, it should be considered beta software.

More information is on the [Liquid.NET Wiki](https://github.com/mikebridge/Liquid.NET/wiki).

*Note that this is an independent project and is not officially associated with Shopify in any way.*
